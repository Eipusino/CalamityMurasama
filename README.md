CalamityMurasama is a mod that adds a melee weapon, Murasama, a high-frequency blade transplant from Calamity mod.
This mod is designed to add Murasama separately, so that Murasama can be used in other large content mods without worrying about crushes with Calamity.

If you just want use this mod, you can download it on Tmodloader workshop.

Please note that this mod is currently unfinished, and while it works fine, my goal is to re-implements Murasama as completely as possible.
At present, it has been determined that these functions are different from the original Murasama, and they will be corrected in the future as much as possible:

Can spam: The original can't deal damage quickly through spam, but this mod can.

Incomplete Particles: The original version will splash round and long particles from the target when it attacks the target, but this mod will only appear some round particles on the target.

This mod has been approved by contacting the developer via Discord before production.

Provide credit to the Calamity Mod: Murasama is made by Calamity Mod, and all images, sound and most of the code in this mod come from Calamity Mod. I HAVE NO ownership over it nor its assets nor code.
